## ✨ Key Features

- **Full-Featured Paper Trading Engine**: Test strategies securely without risking real capital! The paper engine accurately simulates live trading logic including local Take-Profit, Stop-Loss, Trailing Stops, real-time market entries, Runaway Helper rescues, and true Realized/Unrealized PnL wallet balance isolation. Includes a one-click reset for paper trading history and balance.
- **Multi-Exchange Support**: Real-time liquidation monitoring and trading on **Binance**, **Bybit**, and **OKX** using the unified **CCXT Pro** engine.
- **Dynamic Liquidation Thresholds**: Integration with [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/AtsutaneDotNet/api/liquidation-trader) to fetch per-pair mean liquidation values, allowing the bot to ignore noise and focus on high-impact events. Includes a dynamic minimum safeguard configuration (`REPLACE_BELOW_MIN_THRESHOLD`).
- **Advanced Strategies**:
  - **Circuit Breaker**: Detects extreme market volatility using ATR multiples, volume surges, and price movement percentage checks. Halts new trading entries during abnormal conditions to protect capital while allowing existing positions to be managed normally.
  - **Rolling & Session VWAP**: 
    - **Rolling VWAP**: Trade based on price deviations from a rolling Volume Weighted Average Price calculated dynamically from historical OHLCV data. Supports configurable timeframes (`VWAP_TIMEFRAME`) and period lengths (`VWAP_PERIOD`), with independent long and short offset percentages.
    - **Session VWAP**: Track price deviations against a session-anchored Volume Weighted Average Price (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) which resets cumulative calculations at the start of each session timeframe.
  - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Identify overbought or oversold conditions. Configure advanced threshold directions (`above`/`under`) and custom signal actions, complete with guards requiring RSI values to align logically (e.g., oversold signals are restricted below 50, overbought above 50).
  - **DMI (Directional Movement Index)**: Detect trend strength and exhaustion. Generates entry signals based on customizable threshold direction (`above`/`under`) and DI crossover logic.
  - **Market Sentiment**: Trade alongside or against market sentiment using CoinMarketCap's index. Custom mapping for Bullish/Bearish and Extreme Fear/Greed signals.
  - **Sneaky Pivot**: 3-Candle price action pattern recognition coupled with Previous Day Reference Levels (Range High/Low and Swing High/Low). Triggers BUY signals when Candle 3 breaks above Candle 2 High and price is below enabled Low Reference Levels, or SELL signals when Candle 3 breaks below Candle 2 Low and price is above enabled High Reference Levels.
  - **Bollinger Bands (BB)**: Trade based on Bollinger Bands using Single or Double confirmation modes.
    - **Single Mode**: Classical mean-reversion logic. BUYS when price drops below the Lower Band, SELLS when price rises above the Upper Band.
    - **Double Mode**: Configurable behavior. Evaluate trend reversals using inner and outer bands with multi-candle lookback confirmations, act as a standard extreme breakout indicator, or trigger entries within the inner and outer band zones.
  - **Confluence Mode**: Require all enabled strategies (VWAP, RSI, DMI, Market Sentiment, Sneaky Pivot, BB) to align in the same direction before executing a trade for maximum precision.
  - **DCA Martingale**: **<font color="red">(EXPERIMENTAL)</font>** Position-based order sizing that scales based on unrealized PnL percentages. Multiplier = `ceil(abs(PnL% / Leverage))`.
- **Intelligent Filtering**:
  - **24H Volume Filter**: Automatically exclude coins with a 24-hour trading volume below a specified USD threshold, avoiding low-liquidity assets.
  - **CMC Filter**: Automatically restrict trading to the Top N coins ranked by market cap via CoinMarketCap API.
  - **Market Sentiment**: Integrate real-time market sentiment into decision-making and dashboard visibility.
  - **Coin Blacklist**: Prevent the bot from trading on specific symbols (e.g., highly volatile or low-liquidity assets).
  - **Value Threshold**: Filter liquidations by USD or BTC value.
- **Robust Risk Management**:
  - **Max Position Size Limit**: Prevent the bot from adding to an existing position (e.g., via DCA) if the margin used for that specific position exceeds a configured percentage of your total wallet balance.
  - Dynamic **Take Profit** and **Stop Loss** placement utilizing precise `reduceOnly` market orders and exact size targeting.
  - **Native Trailing Stop**: Lock in gains during strong trends with exchange-native trailing stops and activation prices.
  - **Unified PnL Tracking**: Calculate and display daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and total PnL statistics across all supported exchanges, including **Max Drawdown** tracking for both live and paper trading.
  - Configurable **Leverage** and **Trade Size** (as a percentage of wallet balance).
  - **Max Leverage Safeguard**: Automatically checks the maximum allowed leverage on the exchange for the specific symbol (via market limit cache or `fetchLeverageTiers` API) and skips the trade if the configured `TRADE_LEVERAGE` exceeds it, preventing API errors and protecting account health.
  - **Max Positions Limit**: Control exposure by limiting the number of simultaneous trades.
  - **Isolation Trading System**: Automatically stop opening new positions when margin usage exceeds a safe threshold, reserving capital to manage current open positions. Optionally, automatically halve TP, trailing distance, and trailing activation values to quickly secure profits.
- **Fund Management**:
  - **Automatic Internal Transfer**: Automatically takes profit by transferring a specified percentage of profit from the trading account to the funding account when the wallet value exceeds a predefined threshold.
- **Premium Web UI**:
  - **Modern Multi-Tab Interface**: A fully responsive, premium configuration system with detailed descriptions, desktop drag-to-scroll swipe gestures, and a modernized glassmorphism telemetry dashboard.
  - **System-Wide Currency Support**: Seamlessly switch dashboard display currencies across USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, CNY, INR, IDR, and ETH with precise formatting.
  - **Share Statistics**: Export and share visual performance statistics via a built-in screenshot tool.
  - **Import/Export Settings**: Seamlessly backup and restore your strategy configurations without exposing sensitive API keys.
  - **Real-time Dashboard**: Live liquidation feeds, active positions, and PnL tracking.
  - **Position Metrics**: Real-time tracking of current vs max positions and used margin percentage.
  - **Trade Decisions Page**: A dedicated, dynamic log of every trade evaluation that intelligently hides disabled strategy columns, showing detailed indicators and values via interactive tooltips.
  - **Live Health & Connection Monitor**: Dedicated connection status page and sidebar health widget for real-time system telemetry.
  - **Desktop & Browser Notifications**: Real-time system-level notifications for instant updates on executed orders and trade entries.
  - **Toast Notifications & Auto-Sync**: Toast alerts for order executions with automated database cleanups that instantly clear closed positions from the SQLite state, keeping the dashboard highly responsive.
  - **Live Logs**: View bot terminal output directly in the browser.
- **Reliability & Security**:
  - **Auto-Stop Safeguard**: Automatically stops the engine if 15 consecutive errors occur within 60 seconds, protecting capital from API or network failures.
  - **SQLite-backed persistence**: Positions, historical PnL, and trade data are stored safely.
  - **Bidirectional Position Reconciliation**: True live position tracking with automated cleanup of closed positions and seamless stale position recovery if WebSockets disconnect.
  - **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Sensitive API keys are encrypted at rest in the database.
